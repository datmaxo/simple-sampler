Hello!

This is a small app I made to help record my PC's audio, for the purpose of quickly & passively
gathering samples and clips, editing them down, and exporting them.

While this was initially designed to act as a background process, a simple UI can optionally be 
used whilst recording for ease of operation.
Please check the other tabs to familiarise yourself with the controls, and select your recording 
options. When you're ready you can press the button below (or 'return') to start!

Happy recording :)
